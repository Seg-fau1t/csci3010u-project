# csci3010u-project
This is a simulation of the Plinko board game

## Running
This project uses pygame for rendering and scipy/numpy for numerical
calculation. As long as a recent version of these libraries are on your system it
should work just fine. I used pipenv for dependency management so that will work
as well.

native python (make sure that the dependency's are installed)
```sh
python3 main.py
```
with pipenv
```sh
pipenv run python3 main.py
```
